1. What is FUCC?

   FUCC is a parser generator and parser for Common Lisp.


2. What does the name mean?

   FUCC is a FU Compiler Compiler.


2a. What is FU?

   Deliberately nothing.


3. What kind of parsers are supported?

   Current version of FUCC implements LL (Strong-LL) parser and
   LR-related parsers: LR1, LALR, LR0, SLR.


4. What kind of parser do you plan to implement?

   I plan to add GLR parsing.  Perhaps, Early, CYK and other parsers
   too.

   Then FUCC will be world-dominating parser toolkit for Common Lisp.
