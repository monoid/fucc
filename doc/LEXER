* Lexer

Lexer is a function of zero arguments or, when LEXER-OPTION of
DEFPARSER contains :CONTEXT, of one argument. The function returns two
values: token id as symbol and semantic information (any Lisp object).
NIL as a token id is a sign of end of input stream.  Its semantic
value is ignored.

If :LEXER-OPTION contains :CONTEXT, function's argument is a list of
symbols that do not lead to immediate error in current context.  LL
parser do not support this option yet.  For accurate results you have
to use LR(1) (LALR, LR0 and SLR may give false positives: tokens that
do not lead to error immediately, but after some reductions).
