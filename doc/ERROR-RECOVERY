* Error recovery

FUCC signals about different problems (input errors, shift/reduce or
reduce/reduce conflicts).  You can continue parsing with different
restarts.  See Common Lisp HyperSpec, 9.1 Conditions.

The text below defines error recovery model for LR-related parsers
(LR1, LALR, LR0, SLR).

** Conditions

*** FUCC:PARSE-ERROR-CONDITION
Parsing error.

**** Readers
FUCC:ERROR-TOKEN-ID
FUCC:ERROR-DATA

Token ID and data received from lexer.

**** Restarts
FUCC:SKIP-TOKEN
  Get next token from lexer.

FUCC:USE-TOKEN token data
  Use the TOKEN (symbol, including NIL as end of stream) and DATA
  (semantics) instead of old one.

FUCC:INSERT-TOKEN token data
  Insert TOKEN and DATA into stream: process TOKEN and DATA, then
  process old token.

  Perhaps, this restart will be removed in favor of
  FUCC:INSERT-TOKEN-LIST.

FUCC:INSERT-TOKEN-LIST list
  Insert list of tokens into stream, process them, then process old
  token.

  List consists of cons pairs (TOKEN . DATA).


*** FUCC:LR-PARSE-ERROR-CONDITION
Subclass of FUCC:PARSE-ERROR-CONDITION.

**** Readers
FUCC:ERROR-CONFIG
  Configuration of LR-parser.

*** FUCC:PARSE-CONFLICT-CONDITION
Shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflict.  Reader FUCC:POSSIBLE-ACTIONS
returns list of conflicting actions.

This is subtype of FUCC:PARSE-ERROR-CONDITION.

**** Readers
FUCC:POSSIBLE-ACTIONS
  List of conflicting actions.

**** Restarts
FUCC:USE-ACTION action
  Use action for recovery.  Action can be selected from list of
  conflicting action or something else.

*** Other condition
During semantic value evaluation, restart FUCC:USE-VALUE is available.
You can use it when handling errors in semantic actions.

**** Restarts
FUCC:USE-VALUE value
  Use this value instead.
