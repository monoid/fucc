* Table-driver LL-parser
Static parser input is tables and other parameters generated from
grammar.  Dynamic parser input is stream of tokens generated by lexer.

** Static parser input
Static parser input is a 4-element list.

First element is a 2d array (table).  First axis is a nonterminal ID
from the rule, second -- terminal ID from the lexer.  Value of a cell
is a rule to be expanded (LL-RULE structure).

Second element is an ID of starting non-terminal.

Third element is an ID of EOF terminal.

Fourth element is a hash table that maps parser's token ID as symbol
to terminal ID.

** Terminal vs. non-terminal
Non-terminals are kept negative: (- (1+ nonterminal-id )).
This reduces size of largest possible table, but such what is grammar
that creates such a table???
