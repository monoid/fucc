* Conflict resolution

Precedence rules define poset PREC (partially ordered set) on actions.
With addition rules like "otherwise shift over reduction" and "reduce
rule which is defined first" make it ordered set RPREC.

** Conflict resolution in GLR

This issue is not quite clear to me.  GNU Bison splits parser on
unresolved conflicts; but it also "resolves all the outstanding
actions either by precedences given to the grammar rules involved".

Perhaps, using all maximal elements of the poset PREC would be enough.
