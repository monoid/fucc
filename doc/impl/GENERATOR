* Generic implementation of CLOSURE and GOTO

Different flavors (LR(0), LR(1)) of CLOSURE and GOTO has common
structure.  Thus generic implementation of these function are
provided.  Custom versions pass custom closures to create specific
result.

** CLOSURE set proceed expand ordering

LRPOINT in this section may be type other than
FUCC-GENERATOR::LRPOINT, though current implementation uses only
latter.

SET is a list of LRPOINTs.

PROCEED is a function of one argument -- LRPOINT -- that creates list
of possible new elements in compressed form (for example, LR(0)
version returns list of nonterminals).  The object must be
comparable with EQUAL.

EXPAND is a function of one argument that expands (uncompresses)
objects returned by PROCEED.  For example, LR(0) version for every
nonterminal returns list of LRPOINTs with rules of the nonterminal.

ORDERING is function to order LRPOINTs.
