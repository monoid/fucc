* What's FUCC

FUCC is FU Compiler Compiler.  FUCC converts LALR(1) or LR(1)
context-free grammar into Common Lisp program that parses input with
actions.

FUCC consists of two parts: generator and parser.  Generator is used
for generating parsing tables.  Parser uses the tables for parsing an
input.  If your grammar is fixed, you need generator for compilation only
and don't need to distribute it.

See files in doc directory, especially doc/FUCC-FAQ.
